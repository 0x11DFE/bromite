# How to build

The [bromite main repository](https://github.com/bromite/bromite) contains tags for each corresponding Chromium release (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git).

Each tag has the corresponding patches that can be applied on top of the chromium codebase.

Please refer to official Chromium build documentation to get started on how to build Chromium; if you can build Chromium for Android, you can build Bromite.

# Releases

A build server goes through the very lengthy build operation and then new versions are available in this project as [releases](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/releases).

Each tag corresponds to a Chromium release tag.
